# What: Environment variables for the Librarian Discord bot.
# How: Copy to .env at project root (discord_bot) and fill values. Lists are comma-separated with no spaces.
#
# Runtime: Use Node 22 LTS. The project enforces "engines.node >=22" and tsconfig targets ES2022.
#
# Fail-fast:
# - DISCORD_TOKEN and DISCORD_APP_ID are required. If missing/empty, the process exits on startup.
#
# List semantics (whitelists):
# - DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS: Comma-separated guild IDs where the bot is allowed and where commands are registered.
#   - If empty or unset, whitelist is disabled and the bot allows interactions in all guilds at runtime.
#   - The register-commands script requires explicit IDs; if empty, it will WARN and exit(0) without registering.
# - DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS: Comma-separated channel IDs where interactions are allowed.
#   - If empty or unset, whitelist is disabled and the bot allows interactions in all channels at runtime.
#
# Optional:
# - DISCORD_CONTACT_USER_ID: Discord user ID to mention when the bot is used in a non-allowed server. Optional.
#
# Notes:
# - LIBRARIAN_* variables exist as placeholders; no HTTP calls are performed yet by this bot.
